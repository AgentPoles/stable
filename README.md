# Analyze the Voting Behavior of High-Stakes Whale Entities in DAO Governance Proposals

This project analyzes voting patterns in DAO governance, focusing on high-stakes entities and their influence on proposal outcomes. Using the Snapshot API, we track and compare voting behaviors, identify discrepancies between major voters, and analyze voting power distribution across proposals.

## CHALLENGE SOLUTION

<details>
<summary><strong>Part 1: Address Associated with Stable Labs</strong></summary>

### Implementation

- Identified StableLabs' address: `0xECC2a9240268BC7a26386ecB49E1Befca2706AC9`
- Implemented in `src/config.py` as the target party
- Verified through Snapshot API integration

### Key Features

- Address validation and verification
- Integration with Snapshot's API for address resolution
- Configured as the primary target for voting analysis

### Usage

```python
from src.config import PARTIES

# Access StableLabs' address
stable_labs_address = PARTIES['target']
```

### Configuration

```python
PARTIES = {
    'target': '0xECC2a9240268BC7a26386ecB49E1Befca2706AC9',  # StableLabs
    'whale': '0x8b37a5Af68D315cf5A64097D96621F64b5502a22'    # Areta
}

<summary><strong>Part 2: Find Proposals where Stable Labs voted opposite to a whale</strong></summary>

## TASK

Locate a governance proposal within the AAVE DAO where StableLab cast a vote opposite to that of another influential whale (on-chain address: 0x8b37a5Af68D315cf5A64097D96621F64b5502a22).

- [2.4 Code Files](#24-code-files)

## 2.1 APPROACH

The strategy was to use the Snapshot API to efficiently retrieve and analyze governance data. Two core endpoints were used throughout the process:

- `getMultipleProposals` ‚Äì to fetch batches of proposals
- `getVotes` ‚Äì to retrieve voting activity for specific proposals and addresses

In addition, the `getUser` endpoint was used optionally to look up human-readable names for wallet addresses (such as StableLab and the whale). This step was purely for improving the clarity of the final report and is not essential to the main logic or computation.

### Step 1

A single API call was made using `getMultipleProposals` to fetch a batch of proposals from Aave's Governance Space, starting from the latest and moving backward. Only one batch is fetched and processed at a time. If nothing relevant is found in that batch, the next one is fetched. Each batch includes 30 proposals, as set in the `config.py` file.

### Step 2

For all the proposals in the batch, a single API call to `getVotes` was used to fetch all votes cast by StableLab and the whale address per proposal. Snapshot makes this easy by allowing multiple proposals and voter addresses to be passed into one request.

### Step 3

From the collected data, proposals where StableLab and the whale voted differently were filtered out. Their exact vote choices were also recorded.

If no such proposals are found in the current batch, a new batch is fetched and the process starts again from Step 1.
If at least one such proposal is found, there's no need to fetch additional batches ‚Äî the analysis proceeds to the next steps, since the task is complete once a qualifying proposal is identified.

### Step 4

The vote choices were sent to a custom sentiment processor. It uses a predefined knowledge base of common Aave vote options to determine whether the votes were actually opposing.
It's important to note that vote choices can be different without necessarily being opposing. For example, one voter might select "abstain" while another votes "yes"‚Äîtechnically different, but not necessarily in conflict. The sentiment processor helps account for these nuances by interpreting the intent behind the vote options, rather than just checking for inequality.

### Step 5

A summary report was prepared with the final findings. To make it clearer, the Snapshot `getUser` API was used to retrieve wallet display names (like StableLab and the whale), where available.

## 2.2 RESULT SAMPLE

<summary><strong>Part 3: Finding proposals where Stable Labs did not have the highest voting power</strong></summary>

## TASK

Identify a proposal where the StableLab entity did not vote with the majority of the voting power.

## 3.0 SOLUTION

- [3.2 Result Sample](#32-result-sample)
- [3.3 How to Test](#33-how-to-test)
- [3.4 Code Files](#34-code-files)

## 3.1 APPROACH

Similar to Part 2, the strategy here was to use the Snapshot API to efficiently retrieve and analyze governance data. Two core endpoints were used throughout the process:

- `getMultipleProposals` ‚Äì to fetch batches of proposals
- `getVotes` ‚Äì to retrieve voting activity for specific proposals and addresses

Note: API response caching was intentionally avoided. The assumption is that each task should be treated in isolation, which is important since some of the same API calls from Part 2 are reused here.

Additionally, the `getUser` endpoint was used optionally to look up human-readable names for wallet addresses (e.g., StableLab). This step was only for improving the readability of the final report and is not required for the main logic or computation.

### Step 1

Same as in Part 2 ‚Äî a single API call to `getMultipleProposals` was made to fetch a batch of proposals from the Aave Snapshot space, starting from the most recent and moving backward. Only one batch is fetched and processed at a time. If nothing useful is found, the next batch is fetched. Each batch contains 30 proposals, as defined in `config.py`.

### Step 2

For all proposals in the batch, a single API call to `getVotes` (with the voter address set to StableLab) was used to filter down to only those proposals where StableLab actually voted.

### Step 3

For each of the proposals where StableLab voted, another single API call to `getVotes` was made ‚Äî this time with results ordered by voting power (vp). The request was limited to VOTE_COUNT_MULTIPLIER √ó number of proposals (where VOTE_COUNT_MULTIPLIER is defined in `config.py`), increasing the chances of retrieving the top voter for each proposal without needing to query them individually. The response includes a combined list of votes across all proposals, sorted in descending order of voting power.

### Step 4

From the list of votes, a dictionary was created to track the highest voter per proposal. Proposals without a corresponding top voter were added to a retry list.
The proposal list was then sorted to match the order from Step 2 (to prioritize the most recent proposals), and each highest voter was compared to StableLab. If the top voter is different, that proposal is marked as a valid case and the process proceeds to the next step. If not, the check continues with the next proposal.

If all proposals are exhausted without finding a valid case, the retry list is used ‚Äî Step 3 is repeated on that subset. If there's still no result, a new batch of proposals is fetched and the entire process starts over from Step 1.

### Step 5

The result is returned to the reporter service, which attempts to look up display names for the wallet addresses using the `getUser` endpoint, helping generate a clearer and more intuitive report.

## 3.2 RESULT SAMPLE

```log
Received Request to Find Proposals where Target (0xECC2a9240268BC7a26386ecB49E1Befca2706AC9) is not the highest voting power voter on AAVE (aave.eth) Governance
